# Travel-time-prediction

>In this paper, we proposed a novel travel time prediction model, named MT-STAN. We use multi-tricks
 to solve the problems we meet in existing researches, for example, individual travel preferences may 
 affect total travel time. We give the detail experimental results and all models' parameters, including 
 MT-STAN and baselines.
